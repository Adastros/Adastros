## About

I am an aspiring software engineer that currently works as a process development engineer at Applied Medical. My passion for web development began when I discovered freeCodeCamp and started working through the curriculum on my free time. As I worked through the curriculum I knew I wanted to become a software engineer. I was drawn in by the process of bringing a website or application from concept to reality.
